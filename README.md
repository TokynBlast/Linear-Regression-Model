# Linear-Regression-Model
This model is for linear regression, it uses no external libraries

I had only 30 minutes to work on this, so the README will change and improve, AND the code will be improved
You currently need to modify m, x, and b (m and b are functions right now, that will be changed soon too)

Most variables that dont need to change will also be global instead of local inside a function
